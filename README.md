## Pages and Routes

### Authentication
- `/login` – Login page
- `/register` – User registration page

### Documents
- `/documents` – List of uploaded documents
- `/upload` – Upload new documents

### Chat
- `/chat` – Chat interface to ask questions about documents

---

## API Integration

The frontend communicates with the backend via `app/services/api.ts`.  
It handles:

- Authentication (login, registration, logout)
- Uploading and retrieving documents
- Asking questions to the AI
- JWT management using HttpOnly cookies

_All requests to protected endpoints require authentication._

---

## Styling

- CSS modules are used for scoped styling
- Responsive design ensures usability on desktop and mobile
- Common UI elements like header and logout button are reused across pages

---

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file or configure environment variables depending on your deployment:

VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend-url.com/api
